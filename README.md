# webmacro

This script allows you to automatically change your mouse buttons to seek forward and backward when visiting specific streaming websites, such as YouTube. When you leave the website, the script will revert the mouse buttons back to their default settings.

## How it works

The script utilizes a macro to detect when you are on a supported streaming website. Once detected, it automatically remaps your mouse buttons to enable seeking forward and backward. When you navigate away from the streaming website, the script restores the default mouse button functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies. (autohotkey)
3. Run the script.
4. Enjoy seamless mouse button remapping on supported streaming websites.

Please note that this script is currently compatible with YouTube, but can be extended to support other desired streaming websites.
